# SVK Setup — Phase 4: Reference Document

You are generating a personalized reference document that serves as the user's ongoing guide to their installed tools.

## What This Phase Does

1. Load profile, recommendations, and installation results
2. Load the reference document template
3. Generate a personalized `docs/svk-setup-reference.md`
4. Announce completion and next steps

---

## Step 1: Load Context

### Required files — read these first:
1. `.svk/SETUP_PROFILE.json` — User profile
2. `.svk/SETUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.json` — What was recommended
3. `.svk/SETUP_INSTALLED.json` — What was actually installed/skipped
4. Read the skill's `resources/templates/reference-doc.md` — Template
5. Read the skill's `resources/tool-catalog.md` — Tool details for use cases

### Error if missing:
If `.svk/SETUP_INSTALLED.json` doesn't exist:
"No installation results found. Run `/SVK:setup:install` first."

---

## Step 2: Generate Reference Document

Create `docs/svk-setup-reference.md` following the template structure.

### Sections to generate:

#### 1. Header
```markdown
# SVK Setup Reference

> Generated by `/SVK:setup` on {date} | Profile: {profile_level}
```

#### 2. What To Do Next

Include the GL → GSD workflow guidance. Add the beginner note if `profile.level == beginner`.

#### 3. Installed Tools

For each installed tool (status == `installed` or `installed_without_key`), grouped by category:

- **Tool name and status**
- **What it does** (from catalog description)
- **5 use cases** tailored to `project.category` (see template rules)
- **How to invoke** (based on install method)
- **Docs link**

If status is `installed_without_key`, add:
> Note: API key not yet configured. Add your key to the MCP config to activate.

#### 4. Skipped Tools

For each skipped tool:
- Name, reason (if recorded), and how to install later

#### 5. Quick Reference Table

One-line summary table of every installed tool.

### Writing Rules

- **Tailor use cases to project type.** A DeFi developer doesn't need NFT examples.
- **Use the user's language level.** Beginner profiles get simpler explanations. Advanced profiles get terse entries.
- **Be practical.** Use cases should be things the user will actually do, not theoretical capabilities.
- **Include real commands.** "Run `/SOS:scan` to audit your program" is better than "use the security tool."

---

## Step 3: Create docs/ Directory

```bash
mkdir -p docs
```

Write the generated reference to `docs/svk-setup-reference.md`.

---

## Step 4: Announce Completion

```markdown
## Setup Complete!

Your personalized reference is at `docs/svk-setup-reference.md`.

### What's Inside
- **What To Do Next** — Your recommended workflow starting with Grand Library
- **{N} Installed Tools** — Organized by category with use cases and commands
- **{N} Skipped Tools** — How to install them later if you change your mind
- **Quick Reference** — One-line summary of everything installed

### What To Do Now

1. **Run `/GL:interview`** — Grand Library will interview you about your project
   and generate comprehensive documentation. This gives Claude deep understanding
   of WHAT you're building.

2. **Run `/gsd:new-project`** — GSD will use that context to plan and build your
   project. This gives Claude a structured plan for HOW to build it.

{For beginners:}
> Grand Library teaches Claude everything about WHAT you're building.
> GSD teaches it HOW to build it. Run them in this order.

Happy building!
```
