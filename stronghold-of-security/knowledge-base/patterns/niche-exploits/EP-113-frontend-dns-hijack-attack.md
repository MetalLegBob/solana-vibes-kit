# EP-113: Frontend/DNS Hijack Attack
**Category:** Infrastructure  **Severity:** CRITICAL  **Solana-Specific:** No (but Solana ecosystem incidents documented)
**Historical Exploits:** Parcl (Aug 2024 — DNS hijack, wallet draining), general crypto DNS hijacking ($M+ in 2024)

**Description:** Attacker compromises the DNS resolution or frontend hosting of a DeFi protocol, redirecting users to a malicious clone that prompts wallet connections and transaction signing. Distinguished from supply chain attacks (EP-095) in that the protocol's smart contracts are unaffected — only the frontend/DNS layer is compromised.

**Attack Flow:**
1. Attacker compromises DNS records (registrar, DNS provider, or CDN)
2. User navigates to legitimate URL → resolved to attacker-controlled server
3. Malicious frontend mimics real UI, prompts wallet connection
4. User signs what appears to be a normal transaction → funds drained
5. SSL certificate may still appear valid (attacker can obtain one for the domain)

**Vulnerable Pattern:**
```
// No smart contract vulnerability — attack is at infrastructure layer
// Parcl (Aug 2024): DNS hijacked, displayed false transaction results in Phantom
// Users' Solana wallets drained via malicious transaction prompts
```
**Secure Pattern (Protocol Operators):**
```
// 1. DNSSEC enabled on all domains
// 2. Multi-factor auth on domain registrar + DNS provider
// 3. Content Security Policy headers to prevent script injection
// 4. On-chain transaction verification (not just frontend display)
// 5. Domain monitoring for unauthorized changes
// 6. Wallet-level warnings for known compromised frontends (Blowfish, Pocket Universe)
```
**Detection:** Not detectable via smart contract audit. Flag in protocol infrastructure review: Does the protocol use DNSSEC? Is the frontend decentralized (IPFS) or centralized? Are there fallback mechanisms if the frontend is compromised?
