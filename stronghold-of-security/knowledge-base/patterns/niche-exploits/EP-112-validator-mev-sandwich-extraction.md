# EP-112: Validator MEV Sandwich Extraction
**Category:** Protocol / Infrastructure  **Severity:** INFO (for contract auditors)  **Solana-Specific:** Yes
**Historical Exploits:** DeezNode ($13M, Dec 2024), Arsc ($60M, single month), ecosystem-wide ($370M-$500M over 16 months through May 2025)

**Description:** Validators (and validators doubling as RPC providers) use their block production position to insert front-run and back-run transactions around user swaps, extracting value via sandwich attacks. Not a smart contract vulnerability, but a protocol-level concern that protocol designers should account for.

**Scale (sandwiched.me analysis, 16 months through May 2025):**
- $370M-$500M total extracted
- 8.5B trades analyzed, $1T+ DEX volume
- Top 2 attackers = 48.69% of all MEV drains
- Top 7 attackers = 92.61%
- Peak: Nov 2024 (Trump/Melania token launches)
- Jito mempool shutdown (Mar 2024) failed — attacks adapted within 1 month
- "Wide sandwiches" (non-consecutive txs) emerged to evade detection
- 25% of victims paid MEV protection but still lost funds

**Relevance to Smart Contract Audits:**
- Protocols should enforce `min_amount_out` on all swaps (EP-060)
- DEX aggregators should use transaction-level slippage protection
- Protocols using on-chain price should consider MEV manipulation window
- Private transaction submission (Jito bundles) doesn't fully protect users

**Detection:** Check all swap/trade instructions for `min_amount_out` enforcement. Flag protocols that rely on fair execution ordering. Note: validator-level extraction is outside smart contract audit scope but should be mentioned in protocol design review.
