# Reference Document Template

This template drives Phase 4 (reference generation). The agent reads this template and generates the actual reference doc using data from the state files.

---

## Template Structure

```markdown
# SVK Setup Reference

> Generated by `/SVK-setup` on {date} | Profile: {profile_level}

---

## What To Do Next

1. **Run `/GL:interview`** — Grand Library will interview you about your project
   domain and generate a comprehensive knowledge suite (topic trees, technical
   docs, implementation guides). This gives Claude deep understanding of WHAT
   you're building.

2. **Run `/gsd:new-project`** — GSD will use that knowledge context to plan and
   build your project properly. This gives Claude a structured plan for HOW to
   build it.

GL gives Claude the knowledge. GSD gives Claude the plan.
Together they make sure Claude actually builds what you need.

{beginner_note: if profile == beginner}
> **For beginners:** Grand Library teaches Claude everything about WHAT you're
> building. GSD teaches it HOW to build it. Run them in this order — GL first,
> then GSD.

## Use Case Generation Rules

Use cases should be tailored to the user's `project_type` from the interview:

| Project Type | Tailor Examples To |
|--------------|--------------------|
| DeFi | Token swaps, liquidity pools, price feeds, MEV protection |
| NFTs | Minting, metadata, collections, royalties, DAS API |
| DAO | Governance, proposals, voting, treasury management |
| Game | Game state, assets, randomness, player accounts |
| Tool | CLI tools, APIs, developer experience, testing |
| Other | General Solana development patterns |
